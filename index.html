    <h3>Basketball</h3>
    <p><img src="images/tatum.avif"> I started playing basketball in the 3rd or 4th grade, and it’s my favorite sport to play and watch. A lot of my friends play basketball, and basketball accounts for more than 90% of the exercise I get. Because I was born in Boston I’m also a huge <a href="https://www.nba.com/celtics/" target="_blank"> Boston Celtics </a> fan. I’ve been to two Celtics games in person, and I definitely want to go to more in the future. I played basketball on the team freshman year, but I didn’t really have the time to keep playing. I strongly believe the Celtics will win the championship in 2027!

  <h3>Violin</h3>
  <p><img src="images/Ehnes_Violin.jpg">I've played the violin since the 1st grade, and it’s pretty much been my biggest hobby for the entirety of my life. Violin has allowed me to meet so many amazing people, and helped me meet teachers and mentors that have taught me a lot of wisdom. I’ve also got a lot of amazing memories and experiences through music. One was this past January, when invited to California’s Honor Orchestra, and I was chosen to be concertmaster. We played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Firebird" target="_blank">Stravinsky's Firebird</a>, an amazing piece, and I remember in the last moments of the Finale just looking at the orchestra, appreciating playing with these musicians from all over California.

<h3>Research</h3>
<p><img src="images/Research_UCSD.jpg"> Last summer, I did an internship at UCSD under Dr. Veronica Gomez-Godinez. We were studying tethers (elastic substances between chromosomes), and it was at that internship that I got my first glimpse at what research looks like. This past summer I did a different internship at UCSD, in the supercomputer center. In this internship I had a lot more freedom, and I had a choice over many different topics. I ended up studying <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6085463/" target="_blank"> microRNAs</a> which are little RNA molecules in the body, and how they affect different dementias. I’m still currently working on this project, and it’s been a lot of fun!
